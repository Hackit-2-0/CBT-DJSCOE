# CBT-DJSCOE

This project was made within 24 hours at the DJSCOE Hackathon.
The problem statement chosen was to build a CBT based solution for helping users to deal with depression, anxiety, phobia, etc.

We developed a web-based portal for the same.

The user is presented with a chatbot interface where the bot presents a set of questions to determine whether the person is under depression or anxiety and the scale of it.
The quiz is based on NHS's mental health and well-being mood self-assessment test 
https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self-assessment/

The results of the quiz are then shared with the user, along with helpful tips to deal with it as per the user's response.

The user can also play a game which has series of questions, based on every response that the user enters, the next question is chosen. This helps to narrow down to the actual problem faced by the user. If the user digresses from his previous responses, a fresh set of questions are presented as per his response. 

Based on the response for each question, user is suggested with tips that are not only comforting but also that encourage him/her to face the problem.
